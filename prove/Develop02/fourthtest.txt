10/6/2025|What was the best part of my day?|My husband and I made dinner. We made bratwurst, mac and cheese, and a chopped salad. To write down what we made doesn't seem like the flavors would go together, but they were good. I put lemon juice, olive oil, Itallian spices, and feta on the vegetables. Making dinner and spending time with my family was my favorite part of my day.
