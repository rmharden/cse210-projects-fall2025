// The example I used for accessing the list was under: "The following example generates a random integer that uses an index to retrieve a string value from an array." I used a list. They also had ".Length" but our lesson says to use "Count" not "Length,"(because length, I thought, was Python?) so I used count. I don't know if this will work ðŸ˜­

// Returning the index of the _prompts, or "return _prompts[i] came from our lesson about iterating through a List. This same area in our lesson also has examples of using Count with the instance of the list.
