Displays the user's score. (Is this here or is this in Goal?)

User can create new goals of any type.

The user can record an event (meaning they have accomplished a goal and recieves points.)

Show a list of the goals. This will indicate if the goal has been accomplished or not (for example, [ ] or [X]), and the checklist goals show how many times the goal has been completed, (for example 2/5 times).

The user's goals and their current score are saved and loaded.
